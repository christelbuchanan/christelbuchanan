## 🚀 **About Me**

I believe in a future where technology amplifies human creativity rather than extracting human attention.


## 💻 **Projects I have built**

### [Non-Fungible Agents](https://github.com/christelbuchanan/bep007-non-fungible-agents-nfa/tree/main)
Where creators in Web2 were forced to monetise through platform-facilitated ad revenue or paywalled subscriptions, ChatAndBuild reimagines monetisation at the identity layer. NFAs, minted on the BNB Chain under the BAP-578 standard, allow users to own, customise, and trade programmable AI agents. Each NFA represents a unique persona with embedded memory, voice, and interaction patterns—effectively acting as a digital twin or co-creator.
